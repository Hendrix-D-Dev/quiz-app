🔧 Major Issues & Solutions
Issue 1: Network Connectivity & CORS
Problem: API calls failing with CORS and network errors
Solution:

Fixed environment variable configuration

Enhanced CORS setup with proper origins

Added request/response interceptors

Implemented proper base URL handling

Issue 2: Firebase Authentication Flow
Problem: Token mismatches and UID conflicts
Solution:

Enhanced token refresh logic

Better auth state management

Fixed UID handling in quiz submissions

Improved error handling for auth failures

Issue 3: Generated Quiz Results Not Loading
Problem: 403/404 errors when accessing results
Root Cause:

Public quiz submissions saved with uid: "anonymous"

Authenticated users couldn't access anonymous results

Firestore security rules blocking access

Solution:

typescript
// Fixed UID handling in quizController.ts
const uid = (req as any).verifiedUid || "anonymous";

// Relaxed access control - allow authenticated users 
// to access their previous anonymous results
if (resultData.uid === uid || resultData.uid === "anonymous") {
  // Grant access
}
Issue 4: File Upload & Processing
Problem: Large files timing out, format compatibility
Solution:

Increased timeout limits

Multiple parser fallbacks

Better error handling for unsupported formats

Progress tracking for large files

Issue 5: Real-time Room Management
Problem: Room state synchronization, participant tracking
Solution:

Enhanced Firestore queries

Real-time updates for room status

Better participant management
